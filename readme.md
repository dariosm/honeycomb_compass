# Honeycomb Compass

A bee researcher discovered how to improve honey production by guiding bees in a honeycomb to certain cells, in such a way that arranging a group of bees in a very specific layout, their production as a team is greatly improved.

The honeycomb is an N by N rectangular shape. The location of a bee in the honeycomb is identified by x and y coordinates of the cell, and the orientation (that is, the cardinal point where the bee is pointing at: Nort, South, East and West). Bees move from one cell to the other one in single step movements, and can rotate left/right within a cell.

The initial position for such a design is `0, 0, N`, which identifies a bee located in the bottom left corner and facing North. The cell directly to the North from `x, y` is `x, y+1`.

In order to guide a bee to its final location, the researcher designed a bio-interface to trigger the following actions:
- spin 90 degrees left or right, without moving from its current spot: in this case, the bio-interface accepts commands `L` and `R`, for left and right rotation respectively
- move forward one cell in the honeycomb, maintain the same heading: in this case, the bio-interface accepts command `M`

# Model and algorithmic

Design and implement a system to support the researcher's bio-interface. 
The system expects:
1. one line for the honeycomb's upper-right coordinates (lower-left coordinates are assumed to be `0, 0`), which is used to initialize the honeycomb.
2. two lines per bee: 
- 1st line indicates the initial position and heading where the bee is initially placed
- 2nd line indicates a stream of instructions to guide the bee

The output for each stream processed is the final position and heading where the bee ended up.

## Example

# REST API
Since the bio-interface device is meant to be used by different researchers to conduct experiments, you are asked to design and implement a robust REST API that allows to operate remotely, re-using the system defined above.

# Web UI
Create a simple Web UI to visualize:
- honeycomb grid: the user enters the shape of the honeycomb so it can be initialized and rendered
- bee tour: the user specifies where the bee starts, where is heading to, and visualize it the honecomb
- final position: the user enters instructions for a specific bee, and visualize the final position

#Â Web UI (lite)
Create a simple UI that uses the API you created, possibly including:
- Honeycomb grid graphical representation
- Bees movements according to the instruction stream they receive
